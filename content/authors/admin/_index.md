I am an applied economist working in the fields of development economics and applied econometrics. I use theory and quantitative methods to study the implications of agricultural development and policy programs on aggregate welfare in local economies. In a second line of work, I examine questions related to the econometrics of impact evaluation with a special focus on attrition and internal validity. 

Prior to my doctoral studies, I was a research analyst at The World Bank and The Inter-American Development Bank in Washington D.C.

I will be joining the Economics Department at the University of San Diego as an Assistant Professor in August 2022.
