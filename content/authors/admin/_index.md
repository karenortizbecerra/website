I am a Ph.D. candidate in Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Davis. My research interests include development economics and applied econometrics.  I study the implications of agricultural development and policy programs on rural economies using quantitative theory and modern causal inference techniques.
I also conduct research on empirical methods with a special focus on field experiments and causal inference.

Prior to graduate school, I was a research analyst at The World Bank and The Inter-American Development Bank in Washington D.C.

I am in the 2021-2022 job market and will be available for interviews at the 2021 European Job Market and the 2022 ASSA Meetings.
