I am an applied economist working in the fields of development economics and applied econometrics. My primary research examines the implications of agricultural development and technical change on the welfare and structural transformation of local economies.  

In a complementary line of work, I study questions on the econometrics of impact evaluation, with an emphasis on attrition and the internal validity of treatment effect studies.
