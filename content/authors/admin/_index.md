I am an applied economist working in the fields of development economics, labor economics, and applied econometrics. I study the implications of agricultural development and policy programs on local economies using quantitative theory and modern causal inference methods. In a second line of work, I examine questions related to the econometrics of field experiments. In particular, I study the relationship between attrition and causal inference.

Prior to graduate school, I was a research analyst at The World Bank and The Inter-American Development Bank in Washington D.C.

I am in the 2021-2022 job market and will be available for interviews at the 2021 European Job Market and the 2022 ASSA Meetings.
