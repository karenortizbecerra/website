__Correcting Attrition Bias via Changes-in-Changes__ (with Dalia Ghanem, Sarojini Hirshleifer, and Désiré Kédagni)<br />
__Revision submitted:__ _Journal of Econometrics._<br />
Attrition is a common and potentially important threat to internal validity in treatment effect
studies. We extend the changes-in-changes approach to identify the average treatment effect for
respondents and the entire study population in the presence of attrition. Our method, which exploits
baseline outcome data, can be applied to randomized experiments as well as quasi-experimental
difference-in-difference designs. A formal comparison highlights that while widely used corrections
typically impose restrictions on whether or how response depends on treatment, our proposed
attrition correction exploits restrictions on the outcome model. We further show that the conditions
required for our correction can accommodate a broad class of response models that depend on
treatment in an arbitrary way. We illustrate the implementation of the proposed corrections in an
application to a large-scale randomized experiment.<br />

__Large-Farm Consolidation and Structural Transformation: Theory and Evidence from Colombia__ <br />
_Updated version coming soon_ <br /> 
This paper studies the effects of large-farm consolidation on the structural transformation of rural economies. To motivate empirical work, I develop a general equilibrium framework where the net effect of consolidation on labor reallocation and wages depends on the strength of the pull response in the nonfarm sector relative to the push response in agriculture. I examine this question in the Colombian setting by assembling a novel dataset of rural counties and leveraging quasi-experimental variation in response to a trade shock that changed land use and production scale during the nineties. Using an instrumental variable approach, I compare adjacent municipalities with similar crop
suitability but different ability to produce at scale due to topographic features of the terrain. I find that counties with an increase in large-farm consolidation experienced a reallocation of labor from the agricultural to the nonagricultural sector. Yet, this transformation led to a decline in workers’ income due to a sizeable increase in unem-
ployment rates over the medium term. These findings shed light on the implications of structural change within rural economies and the potential distributional impacts of consolidation across producers and workers.
