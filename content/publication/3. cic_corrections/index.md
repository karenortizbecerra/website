abstract: "Attrition is a common and potentially important threat to internal validity in treatment effect
studies. We extend the changes-in-changes approach to identify the average treatment effect for
respondents and the entire study population in the presence of attrition. Our method can be applied
to randomized experiments as well as difference-in-difference designs. A simulation experiment
points to the advantages of this approach relative to one of the most commonly used approaches
in the literature, inverse probability weighting. Those advantages are further illustrated with an
application to a large-scale randomized experiment."

summary:  __Submitted__. <br />Attrition is an important threat to internal validity in treatment effect studies.  We extend the changes-in-changes approach to identify the treatment effect in the presence of attrition.  Our method can be applied in randomized experiments as well as difference-in-difference designs.
