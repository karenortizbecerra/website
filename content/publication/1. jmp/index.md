abstract: "The consolidation of land in large farms is accelerating in many developing countries. This paper studies the implications of land consolidation on rural employment
and workers’ welfare. I develop a general equilibrium model of local labor markets
that considers both farm and nonfarm labor. Large-farm consolidation affects the
demand for farm labor via labor intensity and the nonfarm labor demand through
non-homothetic consumption growth. The model shows that consolidation may reduce workers’ income if the pull response in the nonfarm sector is small relative to the shift in farm labor demand. I examine this question in the Colombian setting by assembling a novel dataset and leveraging quasi-experimental variation in the ability
of rural counties to respond to a trade shock that changed land use. Regions with an
increase in large-farm consolidation experienced a decline in the share of agricultural
labor and a sizeable increase in unemployment rates. These findings shed light on the
distributional impacts of consolidation across individuals and the potential implications of structural transformation within rural economies."

summary:  __Job Market Paper__ _New Draft Coming Soon_ <br />I study the implications of land consolidation on employment and workers' welfare in rural economies. Theoretical and empirical results suggest that consolidation might lead to a shift of labor out of agriculture along with a reduction in workers' welfare.
