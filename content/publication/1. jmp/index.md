abstract: "The consolidation of land in large farms is a recent feature in many developing countries. This paper studies the implications of this consolidation on rural employment and workers' welfare. I develop a general equilibrium model of local labor markets that incorporates both farm and non-farm labor. The model shows that under certain conditions, consolidation might lead to a shift of labor out of agriculture along with a reduction in wages. Using quasi-experimental variation and a novel dataset from Colombia, I find that large-farm consolidation decreased the share of agricultural labor and led to a 14 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate. These findings challenge the view that local populations always benefit from land consolidation, and are consistent with recent evidence on the bias of structuralism transformation against rural economies."

summary:  __Job Market Paper__ _New Draft Coming Soon_ <br />I study the implications of land consolidation on employment and workers' welfare in rural economies. Theoretical and empirical results suggest that, under certain conditions, consolidation might lead to a shift of labor out of agriculture along with a reduction in wages.
