abstract: "Policymakers are committed to improving nutritional status and to saving lives. Some micronutrient intervention programs (MIPs) can do both, but not to the same degrees. We apply the Micronutrient Intervention Modeling tool to compare sets of MIPs for (1) achieving dietary adequacy separately for zinc, vitamin A (VA), and folate for children and women of reproductive age (WRA), and (2) saving children's lives via combinations of MIPs. We used 24-h dietary recall data from Cameroon to estimate usual intake distributions of zinc and VA for children 6–59 months and of folate for WRA. We simulated the effects on dietary inadequacy and lives saved of four fortified foods and two VA supplementation (VAS) platforms. We estimated program costs over 10 years. To promote micronutrient-specific dietary adequacy, the economic optimization model (EOM) selected zinc- and folic acid–fortified wheat flour, VA-fortified edible oils, and bouillon cubes, and VAS via Child Health Days in the North macroregion. A different set of cost-effective MIPs emerged for reducing child mortality, shifting away from VA and toward more zinc for children and more folic acid for WRA. The EOM identified more efficient sets of MIPs than the business-as-usual MIPs, especially among programs aiming to save lives."

Some micronutrient intervention programs (MIPs) can do both, but not to the same degrees. We apply the Micronutrient Intervention Modeling tool to compare sets of MIPs and identify more efficient sets than the business-as-usual, especially among programs aiming to save lives.
