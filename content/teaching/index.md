I have taught the following graduate and undergraduate courses in economics in a teaching assistant capacity. In my teaching, I use real-world examples to reinforce the intuition and relevance of the concepts and methods covered in the course. I also use in-class discussions to encourage students to i) think critically about the advantages and limitations of different economic analyses and ii) communicate the implications of their results in a clear and effective manner. All teaching evaluations are available upon request.
