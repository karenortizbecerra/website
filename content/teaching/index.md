In my teaching, I focus on developing skills that help students apply the knowledge acquired in the course. I believe this approach is crucial for students to be engaged with their learning process and succeed beyond the classroom. 

Below you can find a list of the courses I have taught in a *teaching assistant* capacity. My average teaching score across all graduate and undergraduate classes are 4.8/5 and 4.5/5, respectively. All teaching evaluations are available upon request.
