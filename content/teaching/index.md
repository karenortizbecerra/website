In my teaching, I use real-world examples to reinforce the relevance and intuition of the concepts and methods covered in the course. I also use in-class discussions to encourage students to i) think critically about the advantages and limitations of different economic analyzes and ii) effectively communicate the implications of their results. Here is a list of the courses I have taught in a * teaching assistant * capacity. All teaching evaluations are available upon request.
